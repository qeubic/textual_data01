Teaching Race Relations for Employability through Data Investigation Adventures

This resource is a repository for resources used and files developed for a project on "Teaching Race Relations for Employability through Data Investigation Adventures". 

The objective is to make the case for the use of interactive data visualization techniques to support conceptualization and theorizing from textual data on race relations. 

We expect that instructors and students that interact with the textual data on race relations through interactive data visualization software will build conceptualizations that lead to theorizing on race relations. Additionally, interactive textual data visualization can support sequential, iterative and inductive approach to social science research.

The constructed dataset of collection of statements on conversations on race relations topics is available as a spreadsheet file.

The project relies on content of three open access journal articles:
1. "Sullivan, J. N., Eberhardt, J. L., & Roberts, S. O. (2021). Conversations about race in Black and White US families: Before and after George Floyd’s death. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118(38)". The website for the article and the associated datasets are:  https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2106366118 and https://osf.io/esbpk/
